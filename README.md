# path-following-Matlab
## Description
This repo contains matlab codes that implement the path following methods studied in the paper entitled:

A review of path following control strategies for autonomous robotic vehicles: theory, simulations, and experiments
Link: https://nt-hung.github.io/publications

## Prerequisite
- Matlab2016a or newer
- Casadi - a tool to formulate optimal control problems [only need for MPC methods (Method 5 and 7)]

## Installation
- Chose a folder that you want to locate your project, then 
- clone/download the project
- run PFtools.m and see the results.

If you want to test different type of the path or controller, just change parameters in variables "path_type" and "controller" in PFtools.m
